# Document Analysis Pipeline - Prompt Chaining Project

This project demonstrates the **Prompt Chaining** pattern from Agentic Design Patterns in a real-world application. It processes documents through a multi-step pipeline that extracts, analyzes, and structures information.

## Overview

The Document Analysis Pipeline uses prompt chaining to break down complex document processing into sequential steps:

1. **Extraction**: Extract key information from raw text
2. **Entity Identification**: Identify important entities (people, organizations, dates, etc.)
3. **Summary Generation**: Create a concise summary
4. **Structured Output**: Transform everything into a structured JSON format

## Architecture

```
Input Document
    ↓
[Step 1: Extract Information]
    ↓
[Step 2: Identify Entities]
    ↓
[Step 3: Generate Summary]
    ↓
[Step 4: Structure Output]
    ↓
Final JSON Report
```

## Installation

Getting started is straightforward:

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up your API key:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GEMINI_API_KEY
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from document_analyzer import DocumentAnalyzer

analyzer = DocumentAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze("Your document text here...")
print(result)
```

### Example

Check out `example.py` for a complete working example that shows how to use the analyzer in different scenarios.

## How Prompt Chaining Works

Each step in the pipeline:
- Receives input from the previous step
- Performs a focused operation
- Passes structured output to the next step
- Can be independently tested and optimized

This modular approach improves reliability and makes the system easier to debug and maintain. You can also use the `analyze_step_by_step()` method to see what happens at each stage, which is really helpful when you're trying to understand how the pipeline works or debug issues.
