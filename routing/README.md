# Chapter 2: Routing Pattern - Smart Request Router

## Overview

This project implements the **Routing Pattern** to intelligently direct user requests to specialized handlers based on the request type. It demonstrates how to use LangChain's `RunnableBranch` to create a coordinator that routes requests to appropriate sub-agents.

## Pattern Description

The Routing Pattern allows a coordinator agent to analyze incoming requests and delegate them to specialized handlers. This is useful for:
- Customer support systems
- Multi-domain assistants
- Request classification and routing

Think of it like a smart receptionist who knows exactly which department to send your question to.

## Architecture

```
User Request
    ↓
[Coordinator Router]
    ↓
    ├─→ [Booking Handler] (for booking requests)
    ├─→ [Info Handler] (for information requests)
    └─→ [Unclear Handler] (for ambiguous requests)
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from smart_router import SmartRouter

router = SmartRouter()
result = router.route("Book me a flight to Paris")
print(result)
```

## Example Use Cases

- **Booking Requests**: "Book a hotel room", "Reserve a table"
- **Information Requests**: "What is the weather?", "Tell me about..."
- **Unclear Requests**: Handled with clarification prompts

The router is smart enough to figure out what you're asking for and send it to the right handler. If it's not sure, it'll ask for clarification rather than guessing.
